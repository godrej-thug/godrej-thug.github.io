<p>
So, I have prepared that one two three right. So, let us go to the first one which is the main excavation thing for us which is two months thing right. So, we really we should not be asked to pay anything before every life that is very clear. See if you have not another thing I will tell you
before you answer my question. The apartments which are not registered also you cannot put that difference amount on us ok. You have to take that in your bucket later on you recover it from the people who are going to register later on do not ask us to pay because we are not going to.
The people who have registered are not going to do that. So, I want your answer on that one first. This is really to be a two months shortfall that they have created. And the other thing is you know we were because the contracts were signed with GLPL right. We were not able to do any
negotiations right. So, we were not in a position any time during midway where we could do negotiation reduce the price. Because you had signed all the contracts for first 12 months which means you should have a clear projection on how you are going to run the society for 12 months.
And if I may add. No other questions on that please. There was she if I may add there. Yeah. We were not even given original receipts right from the day we have been asking. Yes. During the life we have been asking there is no deal business deal that happens without a receipt being
provided if I am paying for it. If I am paying for my services I need to know where I am paying. Yeah. And if you are paying. There is one side of GLPL keep saying that there is already been given to the association that is the deal that is going on. Yeah. And you guys are planning.
Association go talk to the association you talk to the association. We have emails starting from June where we have been asking when Rani aunty was there everybody was there. We have been writing emails to you guys. They said that there is an email where you have written that you
take financial handover we will give you receipts. We will give you the complete calculation. Okay. I have that. Okay. Okay. So we don’t want to get into a conversation. So this meeting is called because I wanted owners and association to be on same place. Okay. And it is a very diﬀicult
task. We also want to move on. We want to move on. We can’t be in this deadlock situation. Yeah. So you are trying to create a situation in which emails when it comes from owners you are saying association has been shared. Okay. That that’s not fair. Right? You are passing the vote.
We have an association. When we have an association we attack to Junaid. Because we don’t have an answer. Right? Junaid is very clearly decided that he will not talk to any of the owners. He is very clearly ignored us. Yeah. If you have to do that you have to keep us also updated.
Right? You cannot keep us on the midway. Okay. And then you can… So we will… I think what you… Your first question is regarding one year of maintenance. Yes. Okay. So see if you look at the agreement to sale. Okay. Agreement to sale. And you know if you look at the registered sale
date. Okay. It is clearly mentioned. Agreement to sale if you see. Actuals. It is mentioned as estimate amount. Yeah. Estimate. Okay. Right. Come to sale date. It’s clearly said that your spend will be on actuals. Any difference shall be billed and collected. Proportionately it will be
billed and collected. Yeah. So can you pause it? Okay. Can I pause it? Okay. What is the last plan you said? Billed and collected. Actuals. Actuals. So from June you started billing if I am not wrong. No, May. May second. May second. It will be… June 1st you might have decided the
invoice. Right? Correct. Correct? Yes. So June 1st invoice. June 1st invoice. August 1st invoice. Where are they? When it was shared. And if there is a difference in charging expected and if it is overshooting, why you didn’t inform to association or owners in the Q1 itself? Assume there
are 4 quarters. Yeah. Q1 itself you got to know that there is a suit up to be maintained in the property. Why it was not conveyed? Here they took them to us. There is a suit up. It’s not all of a sudden in October, November, everyone increased their charging rate. No, right? You started
paying the same amount from June 1st. For May, June 1st is the invoice. And I got to know that from all the invasions are in the PDF format. But whatever you are sharing with association. Exception. Exception. Which is coming for us. Exception. Yeah. Which can be manipulated at
any point of time. And that is a shared thing. Anything. So the question is JLP is raising the invasions and those are in PDF format from June onwards. But you never shared with association or owners. And there has to be a minimum responsibility when you are running it for the first
year. To make sure that we are aware of what is, where is it being spent, how can we control it. It’s not like we have given you the right to spend it like how you please. I remember. We have, it is hard on money. We have paid it. I have had conversations with you while paying it. Is it 3
rupees? You said it’s on the higher side Praveen. It is on the higher side. It is with the buffer. Where has that buffer gone? And we have multiple times. And now sitting 8 month, 9 month saying it is dry. Is sheer, you know, no responsibility at all from the builder side. And we hear
when we ask about the bills or details. It seems you have been communicating to the association. As GPN is supporting money, we have complete right to spend. You take the hand out, then only we will give the details. I mean, in detail where it is spent, how it is spent. So, while there is
so much delay, after 8 months you are saying 9 month I am running out. You should have told in the month of June, July, August. We met first in the month. Do you remember? Yeah. September we met. October we met. Did you ever open your mouth? All the contracts were signed.
Ideally one mail from GPN should have been done in the month of June when association was formed. July, August. August we again had a meeting with you guys. You should have written one email to us. Us in the sense association as well as owners stating that it is going higher than
what was budgeted. We would like to sit with you and figure out where we can reduce so that we can meet the ends. And October when we asked GPN also, they had said we are well within the burn rate. That is planned. Yes. Where did that burn rate go now? No. It went out of the
window. When we sent an email in which they said that on an average it was always below 3.5. Hey you sir, are you coming from your side sir? Yeah, please. First thing I know is the calculation. Okay, let’s have a look. You can talk early or anything additional to this that we got.
Association. You do more than enough. No, financial. You were there. Dinesh. You were there. Have you received anything? You were asking. I am asking. Every society has monthly expenses. Nothing was shared. So we were always told to take handover. Why handover is left to the
monthly city. In every society there is monthly expenses. Whatever it is. One by one. Okay. One by one. Sir, please. One more thing. Projections for the dwellers. How many projects have gone wrong within 8 months? Approximate? No. No. No. The first time. Yes. Yes sir. I think
that’s the reason I think we don’t get more crowd if we don’t do product. Let’s go by point by point. As you can see, any of the society, 3 rupees collected, it is not promised that we will maintain performance. If there will be price appreciation, there will be price decisions, there will be
wonder scene, there will be multiple factors. None of the project builder will take that maintenance and run the flow. It will always be built to customers because we as a developer are into development. We are not into facility management. We are up for facility management companies.
We had our P&amp;L on revenue of green. So this is not suﬀicient. We will have to reverse to 4.5 and then run this. Sir, you just offer interest. Wait, can I? Wait, let me say. I heard you. I have a response after you. Praveen, I spoke to JLPL’s leadership yesterday. What they are saying is
that Godrej does this every time. 3 rupees they tell because they want to keep the unit rate. When people are buying, they will see the end amount to keep it low. That is a part of sales strategy. That is a sales strategy for you. Who has read the comment? They are interested in this. Can
you complete your statement? No, okay. No, okay. Why are you asking me? Why are you asking me? They are not right. They are still not super fine. We will continue. Usually how builders operate. Once maintenance is exhausted, they will go and touch the car bus. Sir, we know that
this part. Let’s move on. So we have not touched it. All this, who has come, the ones that Cams has done, they have been motivated that we will not be taking any more questions. Right. I have a question. You are saying that you have not touched the car bus fund, right? I remember a
mail from Junaid. No, but that is the unregistered flats. They are not paying for it. No, no, no. The maintenance fund was something around 2.4, but the car bus fund came down to 1.9. No, that is because the unregistered flats have not included it. That’s all. That’s a different thing.
Let me come to one thing. Let us also know that you said you are not in the facility management space or the housekeeping space. You are. You probably, Godrej, properties is not in. GNPL is the one whom you entered into a compromise to maintain the housekeeping for us, the FF for
us. So for us, Godrej is one brand. You should understand that, right? Why have we taken an apartment with Godrej? Because there is a certain level of trust. Now that trust is being questioned. That fundamental trust is being questioned when you are saying one thing and doing
something else. Where did the 125 years of experience of yours go when you said 3 rupees to us? It is not like you said this 10 years back. You said this one in the beginning of the year. 5. 4.5. Have you heard that for a 4-inch property for 439 flats for a building like ours? At that time
you say, when you say you say it’s premium, but when it is coming to maintenance, you say it’s not premium. You have seen the pool that we have. If 5 families come into the pool, the water is outside. So let us not talk about what is the level of eminence. It is not premium. It is not
premium. How will you justify 4.5 rupees being spent? For a non-premier. It is 1 to 4.6. See, October, November, December it has gone. If individual, once you see it has gone about 4. I mean, there are laptops being purchased for 2 lakhs. Salaries of FM managers are 1.8 lakhs. Salary for
the month? No, no. The facility manager or the estate manager who is there, there are 2 of them. There are 3 staff members. It is 1.8 lakhs. Why did we assume that there will be 3 people to manage their property? The cost incurred by us, by the association. I have heard the laptop of
Tula. I will tell you how he is coming to 2 lakh rupees. It is around 3 to 4 thousand rupees per laptop. If you depreciate it over 5 years, it will come to 2 lakhs. That was one of the points which I raised to GLPL when, in the month of November starting, we received no email replies from
them. No email replies. They were like, we have agreed to GPL. You come to me, face to face, I will reply. I was like, why? You have to write it on email. I will never go that way. See, we will work with you to reduce the cost. You know where the higher costs are. There are inflatable,
inflated costs that we have created to the vendors. And the first thing we understand, that is how it works. This is not the first time we are getting into a deal with the builder. Many of us have bought flats in other ways. What we want to do is, both of us should behave differently than
some of the other Agrade builders that they compete with. See, already there is a, let me complete this. Already there is an impact on the brand goad race in the south. Whether you accept that or not, I don’t know. We spoke to Akua. Akua also, you had the same thing go there. Let me
complete this. Let me complete this. No, I am not complaining. I am not comparing. I am talking about the brand goad race. That’s all. I am not comparing. That’s why it’s different. We are different. But the same thing unfolded there. Elections were conducted in a questionable
manner. Let’s not get there. That’s a different conversation. We have been fighting internally just how it has been scripted by whoever wants to do that. Now, that script has been running. People have been busy doing that. Why you have been not addressing the real issues that we have
handled? Lift has been an issue that we have raised. Initially, it was a maintenance thing. I myself got stuck. He himself has gotten stuck in the lift. And he said, I was scared to death when the lift stopped suddenly. He said that and suddenly he goes back. In one hour, he goes back and
writes a completely different email. I mean, is that something that you want to stand for from a customer service standpoint? It’s a question that goad race should do. What do you think? It’s a maintenance thing. I will add one more point. One second. We are diverting. We need an
answer. I have one more point to make on security. Let’s hear from them. Let’s hear from them because we will continue our conversation. One more point on security was a factual point. We evaluated four security agencies and we could get in no time, in two weeks of time, we could get
lesser price, even from a better security agency than NSEC. When we shared it with GLPL, they reduced that price. Why did you keep it at the highest level possible with NSEC and keeping GLPL’s margin, your margin? And now you were saying that it is too much of deficit. It’s not
acceptable, right? You have done your job, no. So see, when you are promising at the time of sale, you should be doing your job properly. You should be doing a contract in a way that the money is suﬀicient for 12 months, not closing your eyes and giving the highest price whichever is
coming. This is not the way to manage. And we are saying to you because you had the funds. You were managing, you were paying it every month or month. And when I told Juner that if the fund is finishing, what will happen? Sumit was also asking him, what will happen when the
funds get over? He is like, it is up to you. The DG will get disconnected, water will not come, mescom will not be paid. Is this the answer you should give? 12 months you should run without any question, right? Are you telling that, no, tell me. Are you telling at the time of sale that we
will not run for 12 months? No, right? Sir, we did answer. Sir, why? Honour before August? Yes. Junai 30th, didn’t write that why he is not shooting. I agree. Why we are not shooting? When we were able to get from the market. Sir, let them shoot. The question is, he, 3 rupees, I agree.
It is not a fixed component. There will be a little variation. Yes. Because the 5 years story we know. Yes. So the question is, when it is shooting up, you know in the month of June, you know in the month of July. Yes. At least if you are calculated on a quarterly basis, by August, Junai
RGLP, whoever is voting that one, should have intimated associates, all owners, who are together to all the 439 owners, that this, we are shooting up, we need to adjust somehow. And we need to come and discuss where can we reduce the Yeah. Exactly. Expectation. Now you tell us. We
have with association. No, we need to answer. Sir, sir, we need to answer for this. See, when we have the predictions, all the contracts we have signed is a fixed contract. Right? With all the contractors. And you signed before the apartment. Yes. So you had predictions available of how
much funds will go for how many months. So if you would have raised and allowed early, all of us together could have tried to cut down some expenses and completed the 12 months. Not at the end moment. At the time of sale. Okay. I mean, you might have had a sale for one year. Okay.
So I’ll also tell you, at the time of sale, you might have also asked, what is the registration cost? Did it, you know, be as per his commitment or did it shoot out? That is a government team. Don’t miss it out. Don’t miss it out. Nobody will buy that. The decorum is not main thing. The
decorum is not main thing. The decorum is not main thing. It’s not about decorum. It’s not about decorum. It’s not about decorum. Wait, wait, wait. One by one, please. One by one, please. One by one. One by one. I’m just asking you the best thing. Registration cost, registration
cost, is not variable. I cannot negotiate with other veterans and bring it down. Registration cost is not that. Please don’t compare with registration costs. Okay. Here, we all met all the agencies and we understood what is the break up where we can reduce. That means actually we can
reduce. First question is, when did I share it with you? Okay. When was the first calculation shared to you? Okay. It was in the month of October that we shared month-wise break up. This is what is going up today. Did you not share it? Where did you share it? It’s the answer. This is
the... No, no, no. This is what I said. That’s a high average break up. That is an excellent spreadsheet. It says so much is spent. What we are asking is the invoices. How much did we spend? The invoices are... This, sir. You can go on chicken, how much did you spend? That is not how
you do, bro. I should find a receipt when I pay for something. Correct? Why are you asking? My idea is that... Sir, I mean, we have given invoices. Sir, I mean... Just give invoices. Just give invoices. Thank you. Yeah. Who did I pay the maintenance amount? We... For maintenance, we
have paid the... No, I have paid for you, right? Yeah. Now, is it not your responsibility to provide us the bill? You have given the invoice, no? No. How was it? I don’t know, how was it? You see, a client here were not hired by me or not hired by me. Okay, but... Whatever... After
raising the maintenance invoice, only you have paid for it. So, there was one... There was one... Yeah, my amount is getting... Just a minute. I will answer. My amount is getting spent. Yeah. Who is responsible to let the owners or provide details to the owner? Sir, that’s what... We have
a dedicated face-to-face management company. Okay. Who is... Correct. We had also asked them... They are coming to the GP. They are coming to the GP. They are coming to the GP. They are also the GP. They are in... That’s what I am saying, they are playing ping-pong ball. Yeah.
You know, putting us... No, there was one e-mail... No, there was one e-mail, he was... I can’t... I will say one thing. There was one e-mail which was sent to Junaid by me. I asked him that... In October, I think in October or November, maybe September also, I don’t remember exactly,
but maybe October mid. I sent an e-mail asking, now on, we want GPL to take approvals from association on whatever spend is being done before paying to the vendors. This was the e-mail to which you replied that, no, money is with us. We will not take your approvals until you take
financial handover. Okay. We will not take financial handover till 12 months. Then do it, no? That’s what I mean. One question, sorry. That mail, whatever he says, October to the Excel also, does it... There is a line saying that, it is shooting... We need to plan something. Can you read
it? Is there any line? Was there any code? Any line? It was an expensive statement. No, that’s all. In your eyes, how much we have spent. No, I understand. My question is, was there any proactive approach taken when it was known that it is shooting up? Is it mentioned in any of the
lines? Mr. Rahman, I mean, I’m sure you have heard all the queries from the owners and association, right? Now, we need a solution. We are here today, as you said, for upon decisions on this. We need your help to extend the maintenance for the next two months. Because it’s very
diﬀicult. Please understand. All the owners, the way they have put their hard on money for this maintenance, right? It’s not as... As a company, before I could come, I’ve discussed with my... Okay. Management only, I’m here. As a company, we cannot bear the two months maintenance.
During the association sign-off, we can sit down table to table and discuss how much GPL can bear, how much association can bear. That’s the response which... No, we are not discussing all that sign-off. That might be... I mean, you understand, but... So, what is your leadership saying
on this? I mean, understanding the point that, you know, we have saturated the entire maintenance point, at this point. And we have another two and a half months still to go by, right? So, how are you planning? Because, somewhere you... I know that there was a clause put across in your
sale date. That’s all fine. But, the kind of strategy that you had during your sale, everybody was put their money into this. What’s your plan to execute, at least, in a way so that, you know, we can cover these two months. That’s what I want to know from you. See, immediately I think I
mean, association along with owners, we are ready to work on the cost-optimization. We’ll sit with you. We’ll see how we can bring down the cost even if needed. But what I’m saying is, we don’t want to pay even a single penny to you, at least till May. We will, I mean, not to us. May
second. May answer. Yeah, I mean, after that, we’ll manage ourselves. We won’t. But we don’t want to, none of the owners want to pay even a single rupee until May 1st. That’s the head. And that’s why we are here right now. Forget about what has happened. Now we need a solution.
Yes, sir. So can you, I mean, rough estimate per month, how much it is? So that’s what I think there was. I understand. So based on the current, I think that’s what was projected 4.5, right? 4.5. 25 lakhs. No, no more than that. No, I think after GST, it was 4.28. See, two months ago, it
would be 50 lakhs. So, somewhere around 50 lakhs. It was earlier. So you raise the invoice to customers and you can start spending. Why, why we will not do that though? Why we will do that? Then I think we will have to compromise on the services as well. You should have called out
what would be the compromise. You should have spoken to the owners. This is what everybody says. The service says you cannot compromise on that. You cannot, you cannot stop this one, the swimming pool. You cannot close the clubhouse. So immediately stopping is different. Service
means for security, security, security. I think the dignity is different. We have to have one second. Before this could, I mean, our legal team has also put that out. We’ll be sending an email to other customers today as well. Saying that I mean, this is the thing. I mean, we will have to
compromise on the service. I mean, there will be no one second, this is the contract you have signed for one year or six months? One year. So, if you have signed for one year, how the rate is inflating? Exactly. We also signed for one year. We also signed for one year. We cannot allow you
to remove the services. So, please tell me the areas where the rate has inflated. We have passed the sign for a fixed cost. It is a variable cost. It will vary. So, there was one more thing. Julian, if you remember, I didn’t discuss with you. We also asked Junaid and also VNPL, Chetan
Bhaskar, and even we had meeting with Santosh Patil a few days back. We asked them to really justify on what basis of the inflation and all that is fine. But we really wanted to understand what went wrong. That the projection, I mean, based on the initial projection, the actuals are so
high. That’s something which may be understood exactly. So, we have not received just, for your awareness, we have not received any confirmation on that. That what actually was a major cost because of which the rates have increased significantly. And what is the approach right now?
Please understand. It’s, now you are aware of the situation what has happened. Again, I don’t want to go into the past. We cannot change it. How things have been done. We are here today to get a solution from you. As an owner, we are here right now to also collaborate with Godrej,
GNPN, to understand how we can ensure that we don’t have to pay anything for next two months because we have already spent so much buying this Godrej property and paying the maintenance. These two months covered within that maintenance. So, please help us with this and that’s
all. So, we can close the number one topic. You’ve given insurance till May, May 1st. That’s it. We will not be paying any next chance. Sir, first point is just sticking to the sale rate. Did you give 15 days notice to every owner before buying the sale rate? Yes. Because the S.P.L. legally if
you are going you have to share 15 days at this time for the owner to read the sale rate. S.P.L. DOD was not at all. DOD was never attached to it. Now, not even a complete DOD was there. After 15th August when we had owner’s Adam was GPM, there are also many people later we got
to know that it was told by someone to not share it with you but later we got from the DOD S.P.L. DOD was shared to every owner. I can guarantee you that even I got just a day before the draft of the sale rate and by that time I was told to go to the K2 site in general it shows the duty,
pay the credit for 7 days only. As soon as they generate there are people who are coming they are not allowed. So at this 15 days notice we have to read through the sale rate if they have any questions come back with the questions you could have complied with that what happened here is
we just enforce that whether you like it or not. You are forcing all the owners now saying that as per the sale rate you can’t tell that. Second thing is you are saying that you are spending 4.7 as a current one rate your one rate has been I am not getting very 4.7 let me let me let me update
my that is not reflected within our community basically one second basically there is R.K. said we need your help to not pay anything until the end of the year in the sense until first of May let us look at what is possible from yesterday 9 no as per as per what was projected I don’t know if
you guys have wanted more as per what we received last time it should have been till end of February the maintenance on May 5 till end of February there was no projection that is what we confirmed there was no projection that is what I am telling you you have to know this you can do
better so so we all understand there has been huge disconnect have taken the property, we have paid the maintenance, we are going through all of this, right? There had been a lot of taxing things around within the society also, but at the end of the day, I’ll tell you, Junaid is also leaving,
we are away. He has already resigned, he’ll be leaving in few days and I think most of them are also away. There’s nothing to hide, but I’m just being very transparent. Right now there is an opportunity for you, project is almost at a verge of if you guys do it in a proper way, there is a
possibility that we can also go for a handover if you meet all the clauses that we have. Please, it’s an opportunity for you to close this project on a right note, you know, ensuring all owners are happy about it. Please don’t get into a situation where, you know, all of us feel that provided
the photo audit happens, all of that completes, and then we’ll do the handover, there’s no handover conversation before that. We had enough time for that. Sir, we have been asking how do we do the audit and we were told, no, no, you take it over, we have done all the audits that are
necessary. You are both rich, you have done all their audits, but we are not satisfied with it. We have bought a property, we would want to do a third party audit, right? There was no funding, best of all. You yourself are running shorter funds. So these things will take time. You look at
any new building that is taken over. It is after 12 months that people have taken over. There has been a rush to take over from August, which is also the reason why it was in a rushed manner, the association was formed. People had opposed that. Please don’t do it. We’ll work with you.
To him, I had told him, we will work with you to sort out any issues, but please don’t form because none of us know each other. I don’t know RK, RK doesn’t know me. Unnecessarily, why create an issue of friction within the 439 owners, right? So the point here is, we were trying to do
audits. We also told him to delay you and we, you know, keep pulling you back. You have other projects to take care of. All we are asking is, give us fair amount of time to do the audits. And for that, we might need to crowd source or whatever, right? No, it’s been a year. Sir, 9 months.
9 months. I am still not shifted there, but still. No, it is not a year, right? 9 months is over. March onwards, let’s say. Let’s say March 1 year, 7 months is almost done. We don’t want to delay it further. We have been talking about handover, legal audit, I mean, an audit team, all of that
right from August. But for whatever reason, there has been a delay. And I would be doubtful if there is no this thing from your side. If you could also have facilitated, that would have helped. Because instead, it was all diverted to have internal issues. We have been fighting issues like,
you know, the association is not legal. Versus, you know, passing new rules and stuff like that. We could have focused that on STP, best coordinated issues, lift-related issues. And stuck to that, and you would have been at peace, we would have been at peace. Currently, we are feeling it’s
a mistake that we did by coming and investing here. Mr. Kamala already told us, you’ve got this at a good rate, now it is appreciated. You should be happy that this is what you will get. It’s not the right statement. It’s not the right statement. I have told that to Santosh as well, that’s
not right. See, one thing which I want to mention, if the funds are adjusted, we put these funds... Sir, we understand. We understand building properties as a very different business. We are not saying... There is a courtesy... Just to correct my words, it’s not... There is a courtesy from
your side, when you are an expert, we are novice. To tell us, boss, you are money, you are in safe hands, but we are spending more than... For any project, we form a body... Sir, I understand. I am not saying... Just a minute. One of the projects, even if it exists, we never go back on the...
Even if it’s a ten-hour project, even I go to our previous projects, if there is a legal issue, still I go on, sir. First thing which we do is, we form a body and give the money, that doesn’t mean that the biller is running away. You guys always think, I mean, GKL is running away. Sir, that is
the state of the affairs. That is the state of the affairs in the government. That is your state. No, no, no. It is a... It is an experience. It is an experience. So, let’s get back on the solution now. These are all side topics. You give a solution because it’s too much deficit or simple. I have one
more point. I have one more point to be added. Okay, I am not sure you are aware. We issue the PIL on 20th Feb. In the PIL, it was clear to mention that on 18th day, the maintenance will start. That is 10th of March. Now, if you consider from that, March till Feb. Oh, thank you.
Thank you. No, no, no. I think you gave a solution. Sir, we don’t return. We don’t return. We don’t return. We don’t return. What? What did you mention? We have observed that... We don’t give a solution. What is that? Let’s not go back into the past. Let’s talk about the future,
please. We registered in Júttu. We registered in Júttu. We registered in Júttu. It was the first period. It was the first period. It is clear from March till Feb. It was the first day, right? It was the first day. It’s not like that, it’s not like that, We are sitting here right now, we are here for a
solution, please understand. So, give us a solution on point number one, let’s speak for other points and let’s close this. As Junaid said, this is a final meeting with owners and association. Okay, I can give you the number. So, fine. So, I came from a management team. So, what is your
management saying that now? See, we have estimate, it will cost 250 lakhs to maintain 2 months. Even if you optimize, I mean to the fullest level, you can bring it to 30 lakhs. Okay. In the 30 lakhs, what can we wear, what can you wear, we can sit on the table and discuss when things
are at peace and then taking over. This is a final meeting. No, things will be taken over. Sir, I’m telling you, corpus, they have not touched. Corpus, they have not touched. I cannot. One question, I have a doubt that they have also touched. One question. You have 21 odd players that
are unregistered. Where is that maintenance contribution? They haven’t paid to us and we haven’t given to them. Who has to pay until they are registered? No. No, they haven’t. As per the safety and DOV, it says that the lender has to wear the cost and you have to voting rights. That
is the case. You show me the clause. Where is it? Yes, it’s written. It’s written. I can show you that clause. It is right there. I have seen that. When we are talking about safety, both the landers have to be paid until that is registered is what I said. If it is really mentioned, I’ll take it up
for legal. Yes, it is mentioned actually. That itself is a good amount, right? And you are saying 50 lakhs can come down to 30 lakhs. Why wasn’t that legal? That means we can optimize it. Instead of insecurity, remove it and put it to 5. Yes, we have to compromise on 50. 56 was before.
Everyone is not too comfortable with that. No, sir. Same reason. No, sir. The point is, the point was discrimination. Sir, people are not proud of that. People are used at the same time. You are talking about the financial load going to come, how we spread it or something, right? We
already had a financial burden. I will tell you one example. We had enough lift issues, right? Lot of concerns from owners and the man trap. Everything was happening. Because of that, the executive board has to decide to add a high security night. Because we cannot keep people alive in
a, you know, kind of a situation. Like there was something happening, life threatening situation. 1.5 lakhs a month, okay, almost 6 months now. I think we already spent some 9 or 10 lakhs already from the owner’s pocket. Because of the quantity of the service. In your projection also,
right? And we are talking about 30 lakhs or 50 lakhs spending. We are already running. Similarly, the other example I am going to tell, okay. Near us to 5 kilometers circle, I am here in a similar capacity of apartments. Work they had, a builder has given a 5 to 10 bottle. They builder
has dictated. And per day consumption is 2 lakhs, okay. And the entire apartment, they are equal to satisfiable to the partner inside. The builder has provided all those things. Here it’s like all we are pouring money, spending money from our pocket. Where something coverage has not
been currently. That’s what my guess. No, we already spent a lot of money. But no one will get the approval, sir. I mean, let me be very clear and candid. Even if you pay them under that table also, they are not in the position to give approval for approval. Oﬀicially. Unoﬀicially, people
are digging and they are taking the water. That’s the correction. So, for his first point, sorry. Where he was telling about the lift, he now he spent 9 lakhs. This is because to save the GPL name, it was truly an idea from Mr. Duneil. Sir, over the night, we put the security because of... No
GPM, nothing was happening. So, there was a man traﬀicking incident in Tabari. So, that is the reason over the night. But before that, previously 2 months, we stayed without night security. One at night, one at 4 security. Just because of lift issue, to save themselves, especially Jureh
and Gain, they have appointed, they have taken association commission. They took the allocated 5 security. Each one, per month, it is 1.5 lakhs. In the last 6 months, one has spent 9 lakhs for the mistake of GPL. A second example. Second example of it. Is it not should be... In the first
place... One second. In the first place, he was telling me what he was projecting. This society is somewhere which is very secluded. And it doesn’t have boundary or protection. It’s called, I don’t know the security agency guy used some word, which says that it is not protected on any side
from any other building. Okay? In such a scenario, when you are giving handover to people who are coming first, as a first resident, you were not putting their life in threat. It was only 4 security. Can you imagine this 439 flats, 6 acres. You have projected only 4 security in night. Really?
When you said it is 24-7... Yeah, it was around 4 at night. Right? You said it is 24-7 everything. Where was the security? We already had incidents inside. You did not predict there was security in Clubhouse? We don’t even know. We even heard from GLPL that there were some people
in the vendor employees who were taking the chairs. They were stealing the chairs from Clubhouse. What do you have to say on this? 24-7, you only promised, right? They were talking about incidents. People were joking. Yeah. Talking about the expenses in recent years. We had to fight
for their friends also. Because of a design or a consideration of competent authorities, STP, now we have also started selling tankers out. Now you always claim that the local body has not provided you the connection. Having said that, you have no authority to leave the water outside.
You know that. If there were villagers then they would have come and created an issue. Today there is nobody who understands it, hence you are leaving it there. But it is a health hazard. Correct? We all agree. You will know. The problem is, no consultation happened. Now we are
selling tankers. Who should be wearing that costume? Whose design is it? Your design. Why would we pay for that? I didn’t sign up for that, right? Anything you say, okay, just because I bought it, it’s jump in early. I can’t pay for it. There are any other costs that I am incurring. So it
has to be a fair deal, correct? And if you are sticking to say, we know that we need to pay money for STP water. So we had a conversation also where we raised it to GLPL that till the drainage is coming in the society, you should be wearing the cost of tankers. It takes 2 years, 5 years, 10
years. We don’t care. That was straight away rejected. Why? There is no need to be somebody who adheres to all competency requirements. You are the only one who does stale agreement, correct? Brigade doesn’t do. Purva doesn’t do. So I am not comparing. If you have such a thing,
why not do it in every aspect of the building, right? Why would you get pollution board certificate? We say zero water to be sent outside the storm house. Zero discharge. Zero discharge. But you are discharging it, saying that I have government authorised people to send this water. Even
if they come and catch tomorrow, I am authorised to... Sir, who is going to pay for that? See, ideally it should go in the drain. It should go from the toilet. That’s a design problem, right? It’s a design problem. See, I have designed my building. I mean, I have an inklet about it. Sir, now
who has an ATR? You tell me. But again, it’s a 439... It’s a major question on... Don’t you think it’s a major question on your OC? Because how did you receive OC without having a proper provision for water? OC requirement is not for habitation. They will see certain safety, fire
movement. They’ll see the structure of the building and they give OC. And after that, it becomes upon the maintenance. OC is not a requirement for this. Any project will discharge water. I’m sure one project will... No, discharging water is fine, I agree. Every project, every property has
it. But if you don’t make it a provision and if you leave it in a land... Sir, at the end of the day, Godlet is a brand which is building homes for certain kind of people. It should be livable, right? It should not be paying a service. So also I understand the point, right? So as much as you
guys have agreed to write it in a letter and clearly mention that you guys are accountable... If any such KSPCV or any such inspection happens or even in future, you’re going to make a provision for the training. We should also. Yeah, we should also, right? Yeah, yeah. So on this point,
definitely we need that letter from you, first of all. But secondly, I’m saying, forget about this aspect, right? The other thing is, even if you discharge the water outside, as even Praveen said, from the health standpoint... There is a water log which is happening in the adjacent land. You
know the situation right now. There are chances that, you know, dengue, malaria, all these mosquitoes will start breeding and that’s fine. First point, let’s conclude one by one. So first point, I think he’s going to check with his management and he’s going to... Why are you leaving it? I
have told you the solution also. If you have two months’ maintenance cost will not be put upon us. What is that we are absorbing? What is that you have to absorb? What is that you have to absorb? But how do you absorb it? One bit first. Why don’t you go back to management and
say that the... Are you additional secretaries for the night time? It is truly to save the GPL. Do you think, I mean, management is unaware of that? No, sir, you said... You might say about it. Sir, you always... There are 19 to, I mean, 20 to 25 meals has been transplanted into
management. Do you think management is not at all... Sir, then there’s the issue. And the response is also to the emails. No, that... The response is not satisfactory, sorry. It’s like saying today, start it by saying that you know you have signed your... You can speak. Sorry to say that we
are getting a response from only from Junaid and who is in our notice period. How to trust that response is... And one more thing... One more question. We had many owners, you know, writing individual emails to you guys asking, I paid 60,000 for example, I paid 60,000 rupees for 12
months maintenance. What is the status of my 60,000 rupees? Are you not liable to respond to it? Money is with you, right? You were half of the emails you wrote, association will respond. How will association respond? We told GLPL of no. So this email was... One second, this email
was also sent to GLPL guys. We told them to respond to that individual email, no response. From GLPL? Yeah. That’s when I told Junaid that stop their payment. Stop their payment. He did not do it and he’s responding me keeping all of the Janta of GPL in loop that we will not take
approvals from you. Why will we take approvals? Then why are you coming now that it is a short of two months? We will not accept it, right? Why don’t you do an internal enquiry? What went wrong? We actually have asked for that. We have asked for it. We will give a statement
saying this is how we deal. There’s definitely some sort of a issue with the funding. You give the expenses to them. Like saying that it’s more of an estimate collected. And spend some money on it. No, we will not come out of anything, right? Even if you give expenses, what do we do
with it? Expense you can figure out. Why should we come out of anything? No, no. Same as what I asked, I tell you, what I asked is there must have been certain projections back then versus the actuals. So I wanted a summary. If Junaid remembers clearly and even Patil and Chetan
and Bhaskar were there, I told them clearly, you give us a summary. I’m not looking for 20 pages of document. You give me a 10 line pointer summary stating that okay, these are the 10 reasons because of which the expenses have gone high, justifying clearly and then let us review it. And
then we’ll see, is it justifiable or if we have to take any action on it? It’s a light one point here. When you see the first email in the month of October, okay? So have you not got the details of the company? They don’t come to pass it on. Sir, this is actual. One sigh, one second. You see
this? When he sent the mail on the month of October, we along with the text of the organization... This was the only mail which we got in October which we published. I remember. They did not send all this breakdown for every component. We received one email back in October. See,
when it was asked that can we do the audits, can we start the bills? You said that you sent us one final email. We still have that email. No, this was his wording, okay? He said you sent us one final email where he would take the financial handover. That’s when he would share the bills.
Every time you would ask him. No, did you not say? Can you not tell me? That you sent on the email. We will share it only once. We will share it only once. Every time I can’t go back to my CSN and prepare the room. See, you don’t have room. You don’t have room. You don’t have
room. You know what is that room? You don’t have room. It’s for you to tell you. When you started the meeting, this is the last meeting. How do you expect that this is the last meeting? Tomorrow, if something goes wrong, we will not come back to you. Who’s saying that? Who’s
saying that? Who’s saying that? You say that this is the last meeting. You say that this is the last time. Fair point. What do you expect? We expect this is the last meeting. Sir, even after a year, we will have the one more meeting. Yes, sir. Maybe it’s the last meeting for Junete, since
he also has this. We are not here to fight this. But this is the last meeting. You will also be sitting. It’s not the last meeting. It’s the last meeting. Let him find first, then we’ll go ahead. What happened? Just take your time. No, that was the same during September, October,
</p>

<p>
Before that, May to October, you take it from security guys, no, extra 90,000, manage it. This is not by reducing the headcount again, this is purely a negotiation that these people who were one month old in the job, they could do, they could say 1 lakh rupees, you are industry leaders.
And guess what, within a span of one week, we brought... With these guys only, and second all that, you give every project, 2-3 projects at least in a year, right? Because it is your national partner. Exactly. Mr. Hemant, within a span of one week. We put it here, we don’t care. Within
one week, we got 4 security agencies, sit on the table with us, we got a competitive pricing called NSAC, called GLPL. We negotiated on the pricing for almost 90,000, it was reduced within a span of 7-10 days. We did that as an association. If they could do it, and that’s why we struggled
to understand that why GPL was not in a position to do all these negotiations right in advance, knowing that you are projected only 3 rupees as your charges for the first time. If it is 2 or 3 of us raising this, you can say that you are re-advised. You come, first unbiased manner, you come
in speed to every owner. One owner who is reasonably satisfied with how the deal has been, show that person to us. One person is enough. That means 439 people are upset, and that 439 is going to talk to 4 people at least, each of them. What are you going to do, right? You also have a
business model which is going to expand in Bangkok, Chennai and all that. The word of mouth does it, this is the word of mouth business, correct? If we are happy, we ensure that they did their part. Godrej stood by what was supposed to be done. Their customer service was better than
many of the others. Shobha, for example, doesn’t give the common area, but we are not bothered about that. We have come into a deal with Godrej. We want you to give the common area to the association. Godrej can’t give us a gal about, you know, conveyance charges too high and all
that. UDS is another thing. No, no, tomorrow, these are 40 years later, 40 years later, if my children want to get this, what is the guarantee they will have it in their name? What if redevelopment comes? I will have to go behind my name. No, I will not have to, I have the time or the
state to go behind it, right? I am an individual owner who has dealt with you. You have to make sure I am reasonably safe. But the common area is already yours. No, sir. Okay, one more funny thing was there were few contracts which were like, what were those services? What was
that? What is that? Pick up drop-off documents and all of that. That was actually active film. That was actually active film. You projected that on the show. Then I would say, imagine if you have that. We don’t have that. So, one second, I will tell you. Please understand one or two
more things. It was a projection. It was somewhere around 3.5 lakhs that you projected for concert services. Apart from that, there was also one, this Godrej ka app, living app. Living app. Living app. That was somewhere around 2 lakhs, 1.5 or 2 lakhs, right? We stopped immediately.
We stopped that also immediately. Imagine all of these cost was included as a part of that 3 rupees. I don’t understand. The service is like my games. Which are the market leaders. I give it for free. You were costing 1.5. Exactly. That was my projection. And moreover, right? 6 lakh
rupees, he only calculated. 6 lakh rupees, they can do less. So, why can’t they do GPL? It’s the same sister company. Exactly. It was somewhere around. It is somewhere around. It is somewhere around, which pushes us from the back. Take the financial, I don’t need money in your head.
That’s fair. I think that’s fair. This is absolutely not professional. See, we deal in professional companies. We are working in professional companies. But this kind of response and attitude is absolutely not fair. I think they have given lots of points. And he is agreeing. Because you are
also noting, that means you are also accepting this life. It’s not all that. It’s not the solution. We came here for a solution. Let’s just solve the points and go back. The solution doesn’t really need it. It has to be one sided. You have this knowledge. Propose. It should be one sided. Please
propose your solution. Sir, you cannot say that you put us in that trouble right now. And you cannot expect that. It has to be both sided. Sir, you put us in that trouble. This cannot be one sided, you mean? You have to be two sided. I had a few months back, where I thought I have
orders. We will proceed for the handover. After 3-4 months, we are sitting again and digging the new thing. Sir, Dhanu... So, in retrospective, when I am thinking about it, it looks like a trap for the association. You created a trap in which you wanted to get ahead with contracts which
were signed for 12 months on a agreed price. But you wanted the money to be transferred, so that your responsibility goes for the talks. This is what you did. Good. What is address close? I think you have got that list. Discussion. Discussion. Discussion. What was he saying? He had...
Hey man... What was close? Do you guys have any kind of proof or letter or discussion? Hey man, this is not a threat. This is not a threat. Lot of people have been saying, we should go to social media, share or stoning. You know, you will say, it’s okay, you are going to do that. It is
going to hurt both parties. Us? No, no. We are prepared for that. You are ordered to do that. You please go ahead and do that. We will have to do that. We will have to do that because that is the only option left now. If this conversation doesn’t get any... Even to the news site where
you are... We don’t mind sitting there. That’s not a problem. We will come to the new oﬀice. We will have a proof or direction. We are prepared. How do we do that? Have a fruitful discussion, sir. No, fruitful discussion. Have a... That’s not a problem. We have to do that. We have to
do that. We have to do that. This is interesting. See, we are not here to argue. We need a solution. Yeah. If you are coming in the good solution, it will be very good for you. Solution is for coming in the good solution. See, this is not a one-of-the-selection winner. It is for its own
reputation. Yeah. Its own brand name. Okay. You think on that perspective and you send the solution. And it will be better for your all-existing project, completing project, also it will be helpful in... And this is not negotiation, sir. We are asking for a fair deal for us. We are not
negotiating. No, no, no. Yes. No, no, no, no. One minute. One minute. Sir, when I bought the flat, I was... Even I think Jimmy was there on that day. When I bought the... Today I booked my flat there. Okay. Anup sir was there. He himself assured me. I told him, he assured me. He
assured me. He will fill this load. Tell me, you know, make more... You know, give it to yourself. You trust me. Anup... Anup sir. Anup sir. Anup sir. Okay, what is your proposal on point number one? Wait, wait. No, no, we will keep on discussing this. Let’s close. Let’s already propose.
What’s your final proposal on point number one? Final. What’s your final proposal? Data. OK, I will make it... One point, please, one point. Please go ahead, please go ahead. Go ahead, go ahead. Go ahead. I want to understand from Junay. Junay you are telling that from starting that
you know financial handover we will do. Still Hasat handover separately we want to do with the 115. Can you tell me that are you going to do that Hasat handover? GPL, separately with association. Or have you already transferred the Hasat handover to GLP? It’s already transferred to
GLP. That’s a misleading information. Now from August you are telling that the moment we do a financial handover you get all control. Hypothetically I am saying if August we accepted that by now even Hemant won’t come here. But Hemant won’t entertain us to sit here because still
only money is with the GPL. You want to handover that’s why we are getting an option to sit here. So lot of misleading information was happening. Initially Junay see we talk it right many times. We clearly said that we will do list each association. Even association was under the same
assumption. That was even shocking for us when we got to know. Even I called, even night called, SCP, DG, everything we will list out. And one by one we will list out. So now what happened recently I was reading one document. Hasat has already handed over to the managing company
GLP and the GPL is reporting to association. Lot of misleading information. Even on that RERA website it was uploaded that we have handed over. RERA website. It is not that. Yeah I mean it has been handed over to association which was an incorrect statement. It was it. It was like
that. Okay let’s. That’s the point that Ganesh mentioned right. Will you not agree with him? You were saying in our first meeting you said you take the money in your hand. We will still manage. Asset will not be handed over. Asset handover is different than the action handover. Did
you not say that? I said it but it is the GLP asset currently. Why did we not mention that? So what you said is one thing like you can see the gym. You can walk around. You can see the swimming pool. Then we will do the audit. We will sign for each and every asset. What you said is
then again suddenly out of nowhere in October you are coming. Fund is getting over. Fund is getting over. Take handover. And then asset handover has already happened. See for that. And then we got the letter of RERA. One more second. The name was there. Association was handed
over. We wrote so many emails on it. We wrote so many emails. We spoke to you as a zero reply. Last meeting with him. With whom? Last meeting. We did not meet him. When did we meet him? He came and there was an association. But it was not a clear justification. What they
said is every month we have to upload. We have to update RERA on what is done. So they have just uploaded it. But somewhere we told them that it is incorrect. I mean you have just put a fault. Misleading information on the relevance. Somebody filed a RERA. Yes. It is a misleading
site. Once they are not there. This is the key point. We need a competent lawyer and a chartered taxon. Let’s just put in here. See for that. A competent neighbor shared invoices. No, no. But we should not stop them. We have see. They denied to produce the bills. We still have that
issue. Let’s not talk about all this here. We will go home and do it. Let’s fight them. And he is still here. He is still here. He is still here. We will get you first. First of all we need to answer the maintenance staff. Second, we need to complete the work before the financial handover. We
need to check the letter. I have to get the transfer. We have told them one more story. That we should do all of it. But for the photo we need funds, right? So we told them that we would get a letter from lawyer. which we will mention clearly that even after 12 months, we do the
independent audit on our own. You are responsible for finance. I think we should do it. I am treated. They are back once again. Let’s discuss. Let’s discuss. I think we have done enough now. Let’s give a satisfactory answer for that. Sir, I have told thrice. What did you do? Yes, I did.
Let’s give a satisfactory answer. Satisfactory, come with the cost. I have already, I mean, let’s be able to optimize some costs but not the cost. Do you have any proposal? We will have to sit and work on it. We are sitting already, right? Sir, today only we need more much. We should
optimize. What is the total manpower? No, no, no. We are not going outside from here. Because, see, last time what you made, you said that lift we will salt. In August meeting, you said everything will get salt. We will put UPS. You said we will put UPS. No sir, it is not salt. You went
outside for the rest of the week. No sir, sir, sir. Not in UPS. I mean, with the device, we will protect the whole UPS. No, no, no. But, no, no. It was agreed that you will put UPS when Murad and Kamlaka... Kamlaka Reddy and everyone worked together. You did everything. When you
went out for the whole UPS, we waited for hours. Evening itself, we got the email. No emails. 10 minutes. I will tell what Godrej means to Indian public. My dad got married in 1966. He has a Godrej armour sitting there. He does polish in 1 to 10 years. Still intact. Now, I want to
project how Godrej is right now and then tell the world. That’s what is going to happen. We just making cash for the UPS. I really want to think that. Junaid knows me very well. I spent once year on this flat without even visiting the site once. Just with the name Godrej. Yeah. I have
not visited once. You know, somewhere that logic seemed in. But that Godrej is all townish. Right from what we feel. So please, rebuild that before it goes on the fact. We beg you. Because you always think, you know, we are fighting, we are fighting. We are not here to fight. We love
you, our position and seasons. We will have purchase the flat like you. What I would say is the same for a change. Many of us will. Do you want to say no, no, no, no. What GPL guys told me is simple. Ender means it’s end of the day co-duration. End of the day it’s co-duration. You are
in a different entity, I understand. GNPL and GPL are the reason why we are sitting in this room and having this conversation. As simple as that. I have taken a half day leave, you are working. Because of that, because of GPL and GNPL, simple in my mind as a customer. Correct. You
are the ones who should solve this for us. You can’t do it. You don’t have any more money from my money. I don’t have money. And I have also done one more thing. One second. One second. We have GPL contract renewal in February. It’s a right time, it’s a right opportunity for us
also as an owners. And of course GPL since you guys are directly managing that relationship with them. It’s a time for them to renew the contract for GPL. Why don’t you guys, you are ready to bear half of the cost. Why don’t you put the remaining to GPL and tell them that it’s just a
matter of 20-25 lakhs. Whereas we are okay. And that’s something which we can also discuss and we can assure them. That if GPL agrees to bear that cost and provide us a proficient services for next one year. We are ready to extend the fund. With a better pricing. With a competitor
pricing. The pricing. I am not saying what I am deciding. I am also saying what I am saying. I am also saying everything. What I am saying is, let us, yeah, so that’s what, the first point only I said let us decide. And if GPL agrees for a competitive pricing. As per what we are receiving
from other vendors. That was my first statement Murli. I said all of us decide. If you don’t listen then what will you do? That’s my request. Because it’s a time for a contract in the world. If GPL agrees to our terms. You guys extend the contract. We are also here. No commitments here.
We honours when deciding. We honours when deciding. It is not GPL’s decision to speak on behalf of GPL. I will have to speak to GPL director and take this. It is not GPL’s decision. I understood. Yesterday I had a call. What GPL said is in the starting of March when you started.
You told them that this is the budget. Suppose 2 crores. 2 crores is the budget. You need to manage the complete society for 12 months. Don’t you have a document in which it can claim it from GPL for 50 lakh rupees. Because they have done this deficit, right? Okay, I have one. So, as
per Reira, the first one here we are paying the advance maintenance. Both for sinking and the car pass fund. So, as per Reira, this is the rest.

<p>
What I said is both of them. We have a site that is going to help me. So we put money from Santosh. And I do not have any chance at impersonation. I do not have impersonation. I speak to my brother. Hello, my brother. I don’t have any chance at impersonation. I don’t have any
chance at impersonation. I can tell you the number. I mean, on the table where we are signing the document, I’ll write that number. No, please understand. No, sir. Nobody is understanding. The table when we sit to sign the document, all of these what we are discussing, has to be
concluded in a proper way. And that only will sit for the NOCN signatures. Before that, because you need to confirm, it’s not that once we agree only for sign-off on the document, then only you will do the wave of no. You have to first assure and of course, we will also go ahead and
discuss with owners and we’ll get back on that. Because ultimately, today, tomorrow, after three months, six months, we have to take the handover. We cannot deny that. We will definitely get back on that. But we need all of these clauses to be met in order for us to proceed. And even it
can’t be a cross-room, two people having a conversation. All the owners have to know. Exactly. It can’t be that you sit in one time and discuss. We propose a proposal to the association. The association will let take it away. No, sir. No, sir. No, sir. We can talk to the owners. Yes, we can
talk to the owners. Okay, sure. No, sir. No, sir. How many were there? No, sir. Because we cannot... There is already a lot of tension within the... Sir, one thing we’ll tell you... ...a little bit through association only. We’re going to let it be transparent. Whatever. I’m giving the... No, sir.
Can you sign it now? Can you sign it now? That anyway will not happen. No, one second. I... No, no, one second. You’re not going to say that. Please sign. No, one second. All the points and agenda today... ...you give us a satisfactory response for each of those. We are ready to at least
give you assurance... ...that yes, we will sign off as soon as possible. But are you ready to give all the satisfactory assurance? Yes. That’s what he’s saying. That’s what he’s telling. That’s what I’m saying. That’s what he’s telling. That’s what I’m saying. If he agrees to resolve it right
away... What problem do we have? We’ll take it. Even then, handover has to be... ...if photo gets done. Exactly. Photo gets done. Exactly. That comes on you, right? Yes, of course. Photo is a part of... No, no. Praveen. Praveen. Photo is a part of that agenda. So that also is included in
the same. Conditional approval. We are ready to do it. Why don’t we do it? We know that we have to do it. Let’s move on to the next point. No, we have no... How can we move on? Give us a number. Give us a number. Without number, how can we move on? Okay, next point is the
common area. See that. Nothing. We have to check the cost. We have to check the GFP. What did I tell you yesterday? The contract approval is a major factor... ...that’s the actual reason. Sorry, sorry, sorry. No, we can’t tell you. We have to come here. We want a resolution. You said...
I will ensure also people who need to be... ...resolution are there. That’s why we are meeting here. Otherwise, what did I say? We will come to corporate oﬀice. Because we wanted to meet all the decisions. Okay, anyone? We need a decision-maker. He is a decision-maker. He is a
decision-maker. We have to make cost estimate. He is not a decision-maker. Check with GFP. Check with GFP. I need to go to management. Why? I’ve told you the decision. That doesn’t mean that... ...every decision will be close to you. That’s the decision of management. That is the
problem. No, no. The problem here is you have not told us... ...what that is. What we are requesting you... ...you work with GFP and get the remaining money. I am flexible enough to tell that... ...I will absorb some part of trust. And the rest of the part... ...GFP should absorb. That
itself is a big achievement... ...for any association. Sir. I mean, that is a P&amp;R of any project... ...which are... Sir, it’s been looking at us... ...from what angle do you see the premium? Which is why we have come and bought the property there. If this was a life-road project... ...you
could have told all that to me. Right? This is something that we have looked at... ...from a budget-homing standpoint. So, you can’t be taking more money from us. We don’t have the money. I don’t have the money. I don’t have the money. I don’t have the company. I don’t have any
money to pay you... ...for the next one month. Now, I might have to say... ...I don’t have the money. Do what you can. I’m requesting you. If you don’t do, then we’ll figure it out. Right? That’s the only option here. You’re not coming to a point of saying... ...that, okay, I’ll speak to GLP
here... ...and get the deficit that we have. You have an approved budget for this amount... ...for whatever new discussions you have. The remaining gap... ...you ask GLP to pay you. They are the ones who are... No, I think he’s saying that... ...he’ll speak to you directly. I don’t have to. I
don’t. That’s the third party. I’d love to go on speaking to them. You speak to them and come back. Everybody has to pay a price for you. So, fine. Now, you get knowledge. Getting people to explore you. Fine. Let’s conclude this. You will have your cost. You will check with GLP
director. You’ll get back in the next one day. Is that fine? A plus B, yeah. A plus B, done. Point number one, should we conclude? Should we move on to the next one? We are wasting time also. Conclude as in... ...he has to get back with a... That’s what I’m saying. And even before
that... ...not sending the legal... ...which is protocol, right? He’s sending the legal invoice to the owner... ...for two months and all. We don’t want that. Don’t do that. No. I’ll be very transparent. That will go to... So, one second. What does that mean to the owner? It says about what
is happening... ...and what is current rate... ...when our funds are getting... So, fine. We are okay with that. But you need to also... No, one second. One second. Let them justify. Let them justify why? Because we’ll have that as an evidence for future. Why? Let them justify. No. Yeah.
That’s not a legal letter. Is that a legal letter? Different. Is that a legal letter? Yeah, he’s saying legal letters. Yeah, he’s saying legal letters. Okay, fine. No, this is a legal letter. That’s an email. That’s an email which... It’s not a legal letter. The email approved by legal... ...will be sent
to... No, sir. That’s not legal. No, it is signed... ...approved by legal. Okay. Let’s not get into that. Otherwise, we all will have to... ...come and sit over here, sir. No. Here and all of the... How are you going to adopt this? Where do I sit? So, yeah, we need to hold on to it... ...until...
...and this is getting... ...more than 50See, I was just saying... ...automizing the cost. 200,000... I can’t... So, whoever is holding... ...so they can let them... ...hold on to it. So, you hold on to it. We can... Why this is being described? Hold on to it. We don’t have to run around... ...on
this. See, coffee... We can... Don’t sign it for now. Don’t sign it. Because, right now, let the discussion happen... ...let the decisions be done. Why would you sign it? Anyway, why would you sign it? Generally, you will come back in a day, man. And just this whole... ...this whole email for
a day. No. No, no, no. Forget about it. We’ve got all the properties in the back door. We’ve got all the... That’s all. That’s all. That’s all the way it hurts. 100...like 40 people, 50 people standing... ...and giving videos or anything like that. They will not care going to court. They have to
get a message... ...from Bangalore to court... ...of the company. I’m telling you... ...let us solve the problem. That is what he said. He’s not saying anything different. He said, first optimize the cause... ...then speak to GPL... ...to see how much you know that we can absorb. So, don’t
send anything today. If you send some emails today... Hold on to that. There’s no point of meeting. Hold on to that. What is the point of that email? We are going to absorb it anyway. Hold on to that email. Hold on to that email. Let us discuss all this for the next two days. Hold on to
it. You get this. What are you coming up with? Tomorrow, you have to get back to us on that. Please. So, Prasad has just started from Indra Nagar project. He will take one more hour to reach. No, I think... ...the boards have so much time. We all have oﬀices to attend to. We have to
thank each other. Yeah, yeah. Another 10 minutes, please. 10-15 minutes, please. I have to go. I can order all lunch for you. No, sir, sir... 1 second... One second... Put that in the maintenance. That’s what I was going to just say. Direct that amount from that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put it
back to the maintenance. We don’t want power and all to be discussed. 150th or will you? I think it will go for one more hour. We will discuss all the points. All your asks, you keep it very crisp when Prasad comes. Let us not again start all of this. I will tell you, we talked about this
one. My response also to you. Please we will tell. This is my response. Let Prasad decide. So the first one we discussed, responses tomorrow you will come back, correct? Yes. What is the second one? Drainage. Drainage to give a lighter. STP. The lighter needs to be modified. Yeah.
Because Manita LLT is a sherry company. We want the name GBM, not Manita. Correct. We will send it to you. You review and give us the letter. No, sorry. I did not get it. So I reviewed what are the letter head sherry positions. Not the final one. So there it says if Manita, upcoming
Manita project constructs a drainage system, we will connect that, we will project to that. So it says that there is a dependent on the grant budget? There is a dependent on the grant budget. And there is no responsibility in that? So basically that is not what we need is, the letter clearly
says, should say, GPL will actively take the responsibility if any of the government authorities or relevant authorities to this particular STP, in case if someone finds a case or someone panelizes due to excess water point or for whatever there is, whatever we are discussing. So we need that
kind of assurance. Complete account table. And also making a provision. This is just for our assurance. And also making a provision in the near future. We need the name of Manita. Because after five years, this is a self company result. We need the name GP. The accountability until the
drainage is done. First we have agreed to give an email from you guys tonight. No, we do not want an email. Let me. Then we told, I mean other GPL employees will give an email. That also told emails will not pressed. Then we agreed for a letter head to you. Now we are dictating what
to write in the letter. No sir. The content. Let me. This is a sequence of issues. I mean any company, any real estate. No, but we never asked only for email. I think it was Junaid’s assumption that he said that will suﬀice. We said no. Legally, any email from Gozre’s properties. No,
that’s fine. But what I am saying is, it was. First of all, we have no time to file with Gozre’s GPL. With all intents and only this is being asked. No. I must try. Otherwise, we have fulfilled the project. No sir. I meant in other projects. Here if you are asking for. I have agreed for it. But
in a different way. GPL is not taking any responsibility. It is saying that at the will and fancy of the Panchayat. Whenever they connect, we will have, I understand. But the rest will be a responsibility. And what is happening sir in the market? The builder exits. There are fines and all
that kind of headaches that come from compliance parties. I will show you examples, live examples from my own friends who are in other buildings. Best comp will come, pollution mode will come, all of them will come after you exit. Because you had some understanding with them until
you are exiting the first year. Second year onwards, we want to live peacefully. We don’t want to be paying 50 crores, 20 lakhs, 50 lakhs to these agencies. That is where we want your assurance. Because you have not done your work. Sir, I am not degraded in anywhere. See, you took
aqua example. Can you refer any of our projects? Sorry. If we are an IHC builder, I accept their pay. Because they deviate themselves. Sir, right now you have come to the south very recently. You are expanding aggressively through LLP. No, no. Currently if you look at the trend also,
the last few. Under the Parker tree, 24, aqua, all these are recent projects. It’s not like you’ve been here for 40 years. You are expanding aggressively. You are expanding aggressively. So the challenge is these may not come out immediately. Nobody shares it also. Because there is a fear
among owners that the moment I say my story, my property value comes down. So it is a mind game then. No, no, no. We are also aware that if it is one percent, Tico will talk 100 about it. Yes. So they are not hiding it. I am not saying Godrej has had that example. But that is a trend.
So we have every right to feel afraid and save car. What is it that we are signing up for? And we do. Mr. Hemant, if you are so confident that we have not done anything wrong, what is the problem in giving this one? This to add the whole accountability until the trend is formed. Adding
to the issue, recently two or three villages, neighbor villages, they went and complained to the care we need. Some native came to inspect. They expected that. Some inspector has come. But they have not seen the way they were. We have seen the contact scenario. I was just given a 85.
Some people were there from the... G.R.P.L. was there. G.R.P.L. was there. G.R.P.L. was there. G.R.P.L. was there. Some were there from the... When the lady came to inspect... I was there. He was there. He was there. He was there. He was there. The villagers have started
complaining. It’s not the owners who have something. That event is being handled by legal head, Sami. Sami has handled that. No, sir. That was a provision given that you can connect it to the Rajkara way, whichever is closed by. People were ready to do that. We can partner with him
and do that, right? Why are we not doing it? Why are we leaving it to the open? I’ll tell you one important point. Rajkara thing is not legally correct. We have checked that people are doing it. But it is like polluting the Rajkara way. That is not correct. Okay. Hence we have not backed
out from that. So then there has to be a lobby from your side who will work with the Pachai. The only provision is Nala. I mean the only train and system. Correct. I mean that we have completed depending on the Pachai. Whatever we have to do, we are already given. Even for the road
development also. Local authorities say, was there just not given us anything. We are not saying it. We are not saying it. For every change. We went, requested the local bodies also, sir. We are not just moping them. I wanted to consider that. Even Santosh was telling us, we will touch
with something. Can we see if with Pachai, you and me are saying this. We are not together going to Pachai. They said, till enmity this road is good because they have given and they have taken care. Both of them are not care to take care of anybody. Hence, this is what your state is.
You should go ask them. We asked them. You should go ask GPL. They have taken your money and they are going on from there. I mean, I am not saying that is true. But that is the concept. We will listen from them. See, check to check. There might be a... That is what we face. The
person who were paid would have changed. That is a new person. Again, the demand will do. We have to explain to someone saying, that person has done that. We are not saying you have not paid for it because you also want to sit from here. Exactly. You don’t want to sit here and
listen. Okay. I think on that later actually, the content, what we were demanding. Exactly. You want on that later. Accountability. We want immunity basically. Accountability. The drainage is done. I was very clear in my last meeting also. With RK, I committed. I will give you the
letter RK. No, no. But the draft, what we received. Draft? Accountability. Until the drainage is done. That is finished. This is our second time. This is not our first time actually. That is done. Second time when we put it down, I replied that we have put the accountability word. No, but
it is not accountability. Until... The drainage is formed. Yeah. The accountability you are taking. That goes... The pollution, the ground material is deep. Then you take the accountability. Till then, what will happen? So, suppose if the grandpa that takes two years. From the drainage.
Till two years, what will happen? So, I will just read through. I understand his... Godrej, Godrej is ready to take accountability. For any future consequences pertaining to this STP drainage, which is clearly mentioned. And then you have to clearly mention, until the final drainage
provision is made by Godrej or Manita. Through an approval of local regulators. So, this line should be that you are taking accountability for any future consequences, until final provision is made with a regulatory approval. You are confident. You will mention these things. Everything is
fine. I will write it. We believe you. You can write it. Just write it. I will put it in a different way. We will discuss and we will send the following. You also believe it. Not that blindly we are asking her. You are not going to believe it. You also believe from your side. Anything me and this
guy are not capable to give, unless and until my legal come forward. Exactly. My legal will be held by it. We have to do that. You review and cut back first. No, sir. 90Like, they don’t want to believe it. They have to say something. Something comes up. As an association, we don’t have
the capacity to deal that. That’s what we are asking. Sir, are there any association to deal with? That is the case. All the projects we only deal. That’s what my persons... Yes, sir. What do you think we have to also... Let’s move on to the next point. They are ready to do it. The draft
will share. The draft will send you an email. The draft will send you an email. Yes, yes. Next point is common area. Can you share the draft email with the legal and the... Yes. But already actually, I think we have... The draft was sent. We have given him the deal. He has got something.
We will take a... Send it across to us. Send it to us or send it to him directly. No problem. Copy us and let him review and get it done through his... Yes. Fine. Second point done. Third... All the projects that were mentioned to you from so many emails that has been coming in... We
have been raising, right? The few of the problems which I have listed yesterday in the agenda was one of... One was this. You need to put something to... You know, that jerk needs to get reduced. It’s still there. Lift. You need to get that jerk. We are doing it. We are doing it. We are
doing it. Don’t change it. Third point. The first is lift. Lift, jerk. It is the maximum which an... Not the developer, that service forward can do. I mean, it is... They are given us in the writing saying this is the... As per the highest standard, this is the maximum. They have read the
testing and give us the report. Anyway, that will come in the audit. But you have to give that in an audit. If anything goes south, you will financial handover happen. Yeah, yeah, of course. We are not talking about handover. No, we have... Every asset will be as per the compliance. No,
no, no. We will be... What is the... No, no. In audit, if anything comes like... It is not as per the standards or some division is there. You have to take the responsibility to rectify that. That’s also I am telling you. Audit, then, I mean, he will give you some 10,000 points. Okay. I am not
able to do that all the 10,000 points. I am telling you all. Okay. Whatever is the valid, whatever is the compliance in last year, I will definitely adhere. Okay. Because that guy is getting paid just because he will just throw the random thing and go. So I am not able to go. Okay. Okay,
fine. We will do the audit and we will get paid. Second point. Second is this common area name transfer. Common area name transfer. I told you this is the logic. I think he is not willing to buy that. See, that is as per my legal opinion. That is what they had to respond to. So there is
nothing. So there is nothing. Conveyions... Conveyions recently come into this cover. Yes. Yeah, before. Yeah. So what will happen to previous projects? That they will figure it out. Correct. So when a government, SRO, when a land is given, or also registered, there will be SRO and
there will be a revenue department who will take the stamp duty and register. So when they both are fine and they are okay to exhibit the sale deed and I mean transfer. Absolutely. They will bifurcate the Kata, the whole land Kata and to the customer. So are you saying that the whole
land Kata has already been transferred to each individual unit? It has been bifurcated. Bifurcated even for the common area? Common area has been loaded. That is what I am telling you. So what does loaded mean? What does loaded mean? No, no, no, no, no. No, no, one second.
Let’s understand this. So this one is a great common area Kata. Correct. There will only be land Kata. Yes. It includes entire land. Yes. Which includes your common area loader, when that has been bifurcated to individual I mean name, then what is that as a builder I am conveying, I
am already given the I mean to be. So there is no land and no land only to convey to you. Sir, I will not be conveyed to the individuals first of all. It is the sale deed. No, it is not conveyed to me. I will just you know put a barricade there and answer it is my land. Yeah. Yeah. So the
common areas, whatever I am saying that cannot be conveyed to the individuals. Can you deny it? Can you deny it? Can’t use that as their income and do something. No. I will tell you. There is something called development plan which is called DP. In DP if it shows Godres 24 as a one
single DP and I think sometimes I will give an example someone in the electricity and did the whole and entered. So that will happen when they have a relink with the DP with other products. So now this Godres 24 has a sold DP. Manetha is one more project, one more project. Yeah.
This both cannot relinquish and have an interconnection with those that kind of stuff. Sir, one simple question. One simple question. This is not Godres’ land. This is like an helping with Manetha. So who owns the entire land before Godres came there? Manetha. So it is all their land.
Tomorrow what will come next door we don’t know. And this Khatha is in their name. This Khatha is the, see only your individual fight. Which Khatha sir, that is what. The project E Khatha is in Manetha’s name. We have that document. It took that government point of view. Why
should that be their name? We are speaking association. It has to be conveyed to the association. I will do one thing. So give you a better understanding. I share the details. Recently one of the LASNA project in HEPA Road. Poorva also had the same question. So RERA has ordered
LNP to transfer the common area in the name of association. That is clearly there though. I will share the details in both ways. Because these are the recent changes in the last couple of years. Which needs to be done. Otherwise what will happen? This common area will be still. The
land will be in the name of Manetha. We are not saying that they will do something. But chances are that they may do something. So this common lecture about swimming pool and all. UDS part I understand. That is committee picture. When you do redevelopment after 40-50 years.
That’s it. It will remain the same based on the trials and everything. This kind of criminal activities will happen. If I have consumed entire FR and FSI in the project. When there is a small parcel near the CA area left. Where I still have FSI to build. Then this guy will, Manetha will
after Godrej ekrit. Then he will come until. I will have the red shed. I will have the shed. I will sell it to someone. Then if you question him saying that why are you doing this. Then he will come nearer to my name. But in this project I don’t have any such thing to do. It is entirely
consumed and it is all big. No. So the entire conversation is what if. See you don’t know you have to be honest. No. No. You have to accept it. If the complex needs to change. How does redevelopment happen sir? They are building the pure. They have residential plot. Plotting coming
up. Already the work has started. I mean the one who is coming behind your marketing oﬀice. Tomorrow if they want to dump something within Godrej 24. From there so that it is feasible for them to carry their load. I am just giving an example. See we have not seen future. They don’t
know what will happen tomorrow. 4 acres. Right. If they combine their CA lakhs. Together and say we have 24 acres. Please what happened? He cannot do that. No. What is it? Because this is a separate DP. This is a separate entity. Sir just to add there is a pretty shared class of it.
Yeah. And also that. The cricket area is there. The small piece land belongs to Manekha. What if tomorrow as you said. Join back. They may ask us to do that. We are not saying they will do that. But that is a risk that we are carrying. The land has to come. And that should be
transferred also sir. What is the picture? So that convoying thing has recently come up now. No sir. This is before. Yes sir. We have come alive. It is all came after Vaira. Okay. It is all came after Vaira. And people have started to introduce that. Even the competent authority also came
recently. So what we are saying is. Though it has come up now. And we are still at a verge of taking handover. Still your registrations are happening. And still there are flags which have not been registered yet. Can we do this right now. Instead of you know pushing it to future. And
making it more diﬀicult. So check with your legal team. And start the process. I have already checked. So what are they saying. All these while we have suffered earlier. Without this tool only. If it is applicable also. We will not let that portion to do. Because we have already have. There
is nothing to convey. We have already loaded this into customers. So what if we register. What if we register under cooperative societies act. What if? Register under cooperative societies act. Who is the competent authority. Registrar of cooperative society. Correct. That is what our
DOD also says. Correct. Currently we have not registered our association. Correct? Correct. It is. It has been registered. The DOD has been registered in the sub-register oﬀice. We have intimated the competent authority. That this is the DOD. What if we do it under cooperative
societies act. The land has to be conveyed. There is provision for the land to convey. Provision yes. There is a provision to convey. Which we need. Right? We need to do that. Otherwise we can’t do handover. We can pledge this land. Because it has happened in Bangalore. In Bangalore.
17 years people have fought with this. We don’t intend to fight with you. There is one more way. There is one more way. Which I think if everybody all the owners considers. Now that you are saying this. That no it won’t happen. And there is an assurance from Manita also. And it’s all
covered area for Godrej. Dedicated only for Godrej 24. We all buy that only because you are saying right now. But to prove it. To make it a solid evidence. Even for the future right. Will you be okay to get a legal letter from Manita. Stating clearly that yes. This property is solely for
Godrej 24. Dedicated. And even in future we are not going to. You know get into this property at any cost. Okay I will definitely. No Manita. In that. No no. I am asking from Manita. Legal. From Manita’s letter head. From their management. No no. See legally it will work. It’s
coming from Manita management on their letter head. With a stamp. With their some senior director signature. That is also legal. That will have to be registered again. Sorry. That will have to be a registered document. Registered document. Registered entity. No absolutely. I am not
denying it. Eventually. So proceeds any other letter that we take from Manita. Absolutely. Absolutely. But what I am saying is. Since he is also saying that the new rule has been. Has come up just now. It did not exist in the past. And still all the properties have been there. He says
there is a provision to get it conveyed to us. Yes. Let us do that. Simple. Simple. What is that provision? What is that provision? What is that provision? What is that provision? So what is that provision? What is that provision? Because that means there is a chance to do that. But
how? That is what I am asking. You have to. I mean through which? Through which? Some. Some. So one example. You are saying that let’s get a letter from Manita. They will not do anything there. Correct. Any construction or anything. Correct. If Manita do a mortgage. Okay.
And Manita goes to a bankrupt. Another scenario. Okay. So they are saying that they will not construct anything. But they are already bankrupt and this land belongs to them. By default legally we will be liable as the land belongs to them. Right. So there are many angles. Okay. One
letter doesn’t work here. Always the best solution is to get it under us. Okay. Through a condensate. So that it is permanently resolved. One we will go for one letter, another letter, third letter. It will be a lot of complication it creates. But see I will tell you everything. But also there is
a clause. Right. For example drainage. Drainage is also written on the same letter. Tomorrow Godreji will go. But if there is a way. That should suﬀice. That way through they have different approach. Cooperative housing society. That we are not agreeing with. It’s registered. If it
register under this only it will not happen. Usually builder doesn’t do this. But this is for us. It is not a script. If you don’t do it you can still continue to survive. But there is no harm in doing. And we want that to happen. So why can’t association take this possible? Sir. Start
conveying it. Why would that be? You are the one who found the LLP with money. It is not necessary. I mean I did whatever the right thing to do. I mean. It is not the right thing. It is not the right thing. The ethical basis is not the right thing. Tomorrow there might be one more deal
saying that. Sir. It is also you have to do. Sir. One more. The culture of flats in Bangalore is not very long ago. Whereas every other metropolitan city registers it under the cooperative society’s act. Housing society’s act. Correct? Not. Okay. The main ones. Because what happens is
complications come later. Not today. Today we will all be happy. We will be enjoying the property. After some time we will have challenges. At that time we will have to go at the mercy of any other. Something happens tomorrow. Who knows, right? Natural calamity happens. The
whole building comes down. Who will we go after? Will we be able to take that action? No. Association does not have any rights. So can you check on this and get back to us? I will let Prasad come. We will speak to him. No. I don’t think we will be able to wait there. Because even I
need to leave. I have got a meeting at 2 so I need to leave in the next 10 minutes. It will take 30 minutes. I am not going. I am not going. One more thing. Again this might be trivial. Mr. Shaji’s heater was opened after 3 months. This much of salt deposit was there. The treatment of
STP, we are paying huge through our nose. WTP. The treatment of it is not being carried out at all. We are paying so much to that vendor. It is not my case. Many of the appliances have gone bad in the last 3-6 months. The life of this thing I am talking about. That is one part. The
quality of the water. Skin diseases, all of these issues. Secondly, we are saying Bescom has an issue. If Bescom has an issue, we are going to DG. DG costs have gone up. Bescom prices have also gone up. How is that going together? Bescom. You get what I am saying. Bescom. DG stands
there. Time from day one, we are switching on the lights. Whatever is there. Lights are never turned on the other day. We have to tell them. Why are we keeping these FM people? Praveen, that is what he said. Take a approval. Because they are not listening to us. After 2 or 5 months
he likes our stuff. Before paying the bill, take our approvals. They are not doing it. Because we found that is only the last reason. So the thing here is Bescom prices have gone up. And our DG costs are going up. See once this government after this change, they have revised the taxes.
Half the time, power is not there. Once the time, power is not there. No, no, no. Who is responsible for all that? We can’t be unnecessarily paying for lifetime. Is it a fair move? You tell us. There is a comment from Bescom. They are asking for the bill. To this point? Yes, Mr. Hemant
and this one, this Bescom bill. We need that one to be transferred to Godhe’s 24th name. I think it’s on the month. It’s not there. Because our GST actually is hanging. I have already given the NOC to Rani. No, they are not considering the NOC. Just now we have received data. For
the GST, they are saying the Bescom bill has to be on the Godhe’s 24th name. So we just now received the notification from GST department. Bescom name transfer, we required NOC. I have given it to Rani. It’s already given. But who will do that one? Association. Sir, it can connect
to the local. Sir, where is the NOC? Rani. He gave the hard copies. When did you give that? When? 6-7 months back, I have given it to them. An association on the telephone. In the month of July. So, who did you give to Rani? I gave it to him. So, he just gave it to him? He gave it to
him. She is having it? She still has it? Another point was... She is still having the document? Then we will see. We can ask her. Till the drainage is done. Okay, okay. Can you show that one second? Just want to be sure that we have at least 5 points. I will take it. I will take the NOC
today. If we don’t do it in 7 days, you will have to give it to IHT. Let’s do that. We will have to catch him. Who is he? Call him. Sir. Sir. Do you want to check the NOC once? That they got it? Yes. So, we will have to transfer the NOC in the mail, right? We don’t have time for that.
No, we will have to give it to him. We will have to give it to him. We will have to contact him. Who was he? Who was he? He was our manager. He was our manager. He was our manager. What is he? What is he? He is our manager. Don’t take it. Give it to him. Give it to him. Can
you give it again? I will give it to him. Call Rani and say if she has it. Because 7 days of the time, as they will decline the gesture thing. They will come again. Not at all. But they will come again. They will come again. What is the problem with the Frees thing? Okay. Rani, you must
have forgotten before 6 months. No, I mean he can also go to the misplace. Obviously. Okay. There is something else. Is there anything else? Done. Done. Bro, we are talking about the tanker cost. Where is the drainage cost? We will have to talk to the tanker cost and Santosh Patel.
Obviously. And you guys have to... Please give drainage. They should do it. Which one? Not the water tanker. Oh, not the water tanker. The drainage one. They will take the cost of the water tanker. Yes, they will take it. The tanker is coming, right? How much is the water tanker? 2.5
lakhs. As of now, it is around 1.5 lakhs. 2 lakhs approximately. What if 439 lakhs, some new double. Just to add. 4.5 lakhs. No, no, I think... I think... No, no, no. Ravi, no, no, Pradeep, Pradeep. I am talking about drainage tanker. Extracting water. That is what I am saying.
Currently, it is around 1.5 lakhs also. Because around 5... Now, you are charging very less. Your vendor is now taking less. No, no. But we know later. Once you... Whatever points you have given me, like water tanker. And one for... Ideally, my management has rejected to date of tiller
cost. Whatever I have... I was given a provision of absorbing. I will also have to go back and justify saying these are all we have. It is not easy. Any corporate... We understand. It is not easy. Anyone doesn’t want... We also know that there is always this buffer kept when you build a
project like this. Right? It is not letting you... You will have to... Five by six are... You will have some buffer. Sir, the point is much simple. We are with you. You please be with us. We know you have to fight it out. But we want you to fight it out. What is the valuation of this project?
Tell me how many crores? How many crores? How many crores? You should know right? How much? 500 crores? No, no, no. How many crores? How many crores? Tell me. Wait, one second. No, no. We have sold it for 85-90 crores. Okay. That is the highest. Tell him. Tell him. I don’t
know. I am not good with numbers. Sir, it’s a... But you know that number. Just 250-300 crores. 300 crores is not a big deal. It is not a big deal. It is sold for 300 crores. What are the 50 lakhs? Owners are not happy eventually. You need to understand that. What percentage is it? On a
positive note. Okay. Once I got to Godrej, I nominated my two more... Two more months. They also bought two houses. Okay. They will be kicking you now. They will be kicking you now. I am telling you. It is a 50 lakhs. It is not a huge amount. It is not a huge amount. Okay. Let’s
look into constructively fixing all these issues. We are getting a 400 happy customers. Think about the potential you have. Right? Because still I believe as Murini was mentioning, I went with the Godrej because of my Godrej law. Godrej is this one. That brand. That brand. That trust
is getting diluted now. Okay. Or that trust is closing now. So, we need to rebuild under Godrej’s little constructively. This 30, 40, 50 lakhs. I believe Godrej is not a huge amount. Absolutely. And we can promote this here. Because we are at the fairs. We can install. Yeah. You can look
at it. I don’t have any problem with this. I don’t have any problem with this. Yeah. I have no problem with this. Currently, the rating is 0.4. We are ensuring 50.5. Your Bangal Lens that you are launching in Budi Gharay, you check the rating. We, for 39 hours, will ensure it hits 5.5.
Yes. We can ensure that. No. You tell us. Otherwise, we will have to protest. You will see. In that, your starting price is 1.9 crore. That’s why I am saying that. I am going to channel partners. I am going to do this. You will be spending some amount of money for Google. Yeah. For
free. Yeah. For free. You want to use your own movie style in Budi Gharay. We will tell to three people. The same. Please understand the sentiments. People are... Please understand the sentiments that we have. Whatever you said, one has much heard about it. Please get back to us
tomorrow. Please get back to us tomorrow by 3 pm latest so that we have clear, definite answers from you. We will publish it to all the owners. And of course, if possible, please send an event to all the owners. Including the association. So that everybody has... Sir, our first request was to
create an owner’s DL. And the owner’s DL. Distribution. Distribution because of all the owners. Like, we have an association DL. Owner’s DL. That was our first demand. Okay. I will put. Because what is happening now, we are not getting the complete details. When we ask someone,
they say, it’s restricted, we can’t read. One DL will be easy to communicate. Adding all the owners to one distribution here so that you send an email, everybody gets it. See, it’s their problem. Whatever you do, all the way requesting, send it to all the owners. Send it to all the owners. I
mean, whatever update you have on this meeting, it should go to all the owners in the box first hand. Not from association, not from any of us. It should directly go from Baudrette. That these are the points discussed. This is Baudrette’s decision. And we will stick to this. By tomorrow,
3 pm, please. Not also. Not to all the owners. You already have all the details. You just need to know anyways. Why should I? It’s all the owners. What’s wrong with that? It’s all... You will have all the owners. How will that help? That will help because everybody will have insight on
what is coming from Baudrette. Baudrette is the owner of the house. Who paid you? Who made the payment to you? I know, I know. That will create... You are liable to answer that, sir. That’s all. I am aware of that. You have written to me. I mean... Honestly, if you have written to
us. Fine, you send it to us. We will share the same thread to the owners. But we need it by tomorrow 3 pm. Today only you send what else? Fine, send it today. No, no, but... No, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. The resolution. No, no, no. The resolution. The resolution. Just...
The owners deal created immediately. Owners deal, it’s up to them. No, no. We have to pay... Don’t be... We want a solution. We want a... Yeah, that’s what you are saying. We need a solution. No, no. We need a solution. We need a solution. Yeah, I mean... Whatever we have to come
back is on... GPL, absorbing the cost. C. I am telling you. I am personally okay if all are okay. I don’t even need meeting minutes at the moment. All I need is a final solution and decision. You take time till tomorrow. Give us okay. Godrej, this was discussed. This is our solution. This is
what we are providing. We are ready to absorb 50 lakh cost. Done. We are ready to give you document with accountability for... We are ready for this. We are ready for this. We are not going to do the... 12 months. You will have to be sure for two more months. Give us a final letter. We
don’t need meeting minutes. Give us a final letter. Take time till tomorrow morning, afternoon. But give us a final letter with proper solution. Otherwise, two months later... Which we can... No security, no water, no this thing. That we don’t want. Yeah. What are the consequences?
Once you fulfil, we will go back to owners. We will conduct a GPL. If we get majority voting, we will proceed with handover. That’s an assurance. After photo. Conditional voting. Yes. Photo is a part of that list. So of course... We will do it. Then how is this... I mean, absorbing one to
three points helping. It’s just like me going back and checking again. No, this is... This is again... So what I am saying is, your tomorrow’s mail or today’s mail... Will help us get a clarity if we are okay with it. Or if we need to take further next steps. If you agree to our terms and if you
give us a proper solution... Yes. We don’t need to worry. We are okay with it. We are okay with it. You are getting my point. So everything is based on your response. So if your response is favourable, we can think about proceeding with it... With the consent of all the owners. If your
response itself is not favourable, then we will see how we need to go ahead with it. Okay. My next point, if I am going to GPL... Yeah. If they agree to... Hmm. If they agree to extend their support and maintain it for next two months. Hmm. Can I commit them that you will be giving
the... I mean... Provided they give the appropriate competitive rates. Competitive rates and also we need better services. Because there has been a lack of... Yeah. We have seen that they are not... They say they will have fair chance. It’s not a confirmed thing. Yes. So they have a fair
chance. They have a fair chance. That’s it. Otherwise they will have fair chance. So they have a fair chance. They can’t sell that because... Yeah. No, so... Otherwise they will have a fair chance. Otherwise they will have a fair chance. Right now they have no chance. They have
absolutely no chance. Because they have no chance at this point. But you can use this for convincing for your negotiations. Yes. Definitely. See, you can’t have... You can’t employ a CEO and then... Managers under it and then associates... To do a foreign property, correct? You need one
escape manager who can run the shop. No, fine. To answer your question, yes. There is a chance. If they give a competitive pricing, quality improvement... And if they are willing to really do it in a better way... Definitely. I mean, if I’m getting a GLP and doing a better services for the
same price that I’m getting from other vendors... Even I... What’s wrong? I mean, I’m happy with it. Can you stick to it? Yeah. But they have to swear... But they are giving him a price. Exactly. Let me tell you. I have... Like, we have had multiple calls. No purchase on the price.
Thirty-three thousand for a security. Thirty? Thirty-three thousand, initially. Now we have reduced it. Yeah. Who will pay thirty-three thousand? That will be negotiated. That’s what I’m saying. Your team would have done it with GLP. Ninety-thousand? Yeah, you said thirty-three
thousand. You will get ten percent. GLP at ten percent. Sir. Sir. No. Sir, it is said that thirty-three thousand they are taking from... But they are making ten thousand by the right person. And the manager is getting somewhere sixteen-seven days. So what is happening? No one knows.
I know there will be some charges for you to the service provider. Just to repeat. Thirty-three thousand they are taking. What does that mean? Thirty-three thousand. One is getting sixty-seven days. Super-wise. So it means a hundred percent margin, right? It’s almost, yeah. So they
are not paying thirty-three. To the actual employer. No, you are not paying. Mr. Hemant, I think you should be knowing it. Yeah. Yeah. GLP is a separate company. We have... Yeah. No, no, no. We are not saying GLP will, you know, you know all the... Insignal as a story. Insignal as a
story. Let me be very clear on this. Earlier, before GLP comes, we used to manage with CBR. I have full control. Without my signature, CBR will not sign entity any contract. I had full control. Okay. GLP is a separate. It’s like fighting over me. I mean, it’s like pure enemies only. We
and GLP and directors sit together and whatever you told, I take the interest and blast them. So we are in that house. We cannot go and sit in their car seat and they show me, Hemant, what is it? That would be lovely. Fine, we understand. So have a conversation and get this done by
tomorrow. This is a huge difference. Thirty-three thousand taking and giving only seventeen thousand. And they are literally crying. If you really have to analyze everything, I think not just two months. They should be in a position to run it for another two months. I mean, four months.
The way they have done all this, Just to add up, some security guards, even they are doing a cook job or part-time job within our society to un-let their livelihood. If they are doing a cook job, there was one security who left and he became cook. One was a tanker driver. He has left the
security job, he has become tanker driver. No, he is running tanker. Inside. Inside security. They are actually coming and dropping this water tankers inside. We know those security guards. But anyway, that’s a separate story. Let’s wrap it up. Parasad is coming. What is gonna happen?
Is he gonna take time? Take time. There is nothing different. It’s the same thing. No, it’s not possible. It’s not possible. No, it’s not possible. Sir, sir, please. No, no, we don’t want it. Add it to mental health fund. Add it to mental health fund. Already depleted. Thank you.
